# What is zktube?

[zktube](https://zktube.io/) is a protocol with ZK Rollup solutions of zero knowledge proof building for users and developers, providing underlying protocol support services, which can enable better migration of applications and contracts on Layer 1. 

PayTube is the first ETH 2.0 smart wallet building on zktube, with this L2 solution offers the same security guarantees as Ethereum mainnet, and a big scalability boost: a Layer 2 protocol to achieve low transaction fees and throughput of ETH and ERC20/ERC721 transactions up to 200 times the original Layer 1 transaction.
