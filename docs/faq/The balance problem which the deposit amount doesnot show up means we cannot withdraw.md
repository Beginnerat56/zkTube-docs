# The balance problem which the deposit amount doesn’t show up means we cannot withdraw? / Why zero balance?/ I check my transaction on testnet, it was successful, but the balance on zktube wallet won’t show up. Why? / I send 1 ETH on the rinkeby testnet

Firstly, there may be congestion on the ETH network, or the failure of the ETH miners to pack, so you need to wait patiently after making a deposit and check the transfer progress through the Ethereum browser.

Besides, each deposit needs to be pending in layer2, but the asset can be used immediately before confirmation, in order to make sure that the transfer has been confirmed successfully by the Ethereum browser. At this time, if the asset of the layer2 account has not arrived, it may be caused by the [zkTube](https://zktube.io/) system, so you can contact the [zkTube](https://zktube.io/) customer service department for processing.
